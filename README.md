### Background

Have you ever had a lot of work to do, but you have no sense of how to budget your time? Have you ever had an approaching deadline, and when you are comparing things with your classmates, the group chat was a mess? This is what is looks like:

</p>

As you can see, over time, the information will get diluted, and there is no way to view information in a contextual and organized manner.

### Inspiration

We wanted to create a public to-do list, where every single classmate has an impact on your to-do list. We all have a hard time of proritizing our to-do list and knowing what needed to get done. We wanted to publisize this process and make it much easier.

### What It Does
We created a task manage that can handle and organize deadlines for multiple courses that a cohort may have. This is a list of to-dos that will be organized by class reps who can push tasks to the main database. On the user end, individuals can "check off" tasks that they've already accomplished, or add their own individual tasks.
